      Hi! I’m <strong>Core Francisco Park</strong> 
      (pronounced <em>Corae</em>), I am a 6<sup>th</sup> year graduate student at Harvard Physics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I work on understanding AI systems using carefully designed experiments. 
      For the last few months I’ve been running experiments with synthetic data to understand 
      compositional generalization and in‐context learning. These days I’m mostly interested 
      in understanding fine tuning and the long‐context limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past, I worked on developing reliable and deployable ML tools and methods for 
      the physical sciences. I worked on different real‐data problems with ML and statistics, 
      ranging from studies of a brain smaller than a grain of salt to cosmic volumes and 
      from theoretical studies to practical ones.
    </p>

    <p>Feel free to ask me anything!</p>
