# MinSu Ko

Masterâ€“Doctoral integrated program (1st year) in physics, at  
Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

As an experimental physicist, I am interested in
- Experimental cosmology
- Beyond Standard Model physics
- Radio astronomical instruments
- Superconducting & low noise systems     

The main research topic is instrumentation in observational cosmology and particle physics.

I am currently working on two projects.

1. Development of 12-20 GHz recevier for carbon monoxide line intensity mapping, targeting z > 4.8 (Ph.D. Thesis instrument).
2. Instrumentation on quantum noise limited axion dark matter detectors.
